  My name is Clinton Morrison. 
  I am a full-stack developer at BiblioCommons in Toronto, Canada.

  This website provides a sample of some of my work.
  I have completed a wide variety of projects from web apps to Java games.

  In addition to looking at my projects I also hope you check out my <a href="[% url 'blog' %]">blog</a>!
  I write mostly about software development, the projects I am working on, and things in technology that I find interesting.
