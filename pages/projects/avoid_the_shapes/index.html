<h3> Description </h3>
<p> This game is simple but surprisingly fun. You control the yellow circle. Point your mouse in the direction you
would like it to move and it will follow. Avoid touching the other circles. They will cause you to explode! You can
toggle the music on and off by clicking the music note in the bottom right hand corner. </p>

<p>Note that you need a HTML5 compatible web browser with JavaScript enabled to play this game.</p>
