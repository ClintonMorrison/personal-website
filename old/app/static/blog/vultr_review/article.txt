I used to use Bluehost for hosting my website, but I had a lot of issues with it. I recently switched to Vultr[https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7293020], and have had a great time. Vultr has been better every metric. I'll discuss the things I liked about it.

Control
-----

With Bluehost, there were a lot of limitations in terms of server administration. You don't get root access to your server, and it's a shared hosting environment.


Cost
-----

My current Vultr plan costs only $2.50 per month. On the other hand, I was paying $15/month for Bluehost. Since my site is very low traffic I am able to get away with the most basic plan.


Performance
-------

I have found the page load speeds are much better with Vultr, compared to Bluehost.

Unfortunately, I didn't save any page speed data from my site while it was still on Bluehost. However, one of my other domains, TaskBird[http://taskbird.ca], is still on Bluehost.  While it's not a completely fair comparison, I used the tool to measure the speed of this domain.

With my new Vultr site however, it took only 169 ms. See the picture below.
